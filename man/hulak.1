NAME
       hulak - File Based API client for terminal nerds 

SYNOPSIS
       hulak [OPTIONS] -f <file>
       hulak [OPTIONS] -fp <file_path>
       hulak [OPTIONS] -dir <directory_path>
       hulak [OPTIONS] -dirseq <directory_path>
       hulak migrate <json_file>

DESCRIPTION
       Hulak is a user-friendly API client designed for developers and terminal users. It supports multiple HTTP methods and facilitates easy API testing and integration by leveraging YAML configuration files.

OPTIONS
       -env <environment>
              Specifies an environment file inside the env directory for API calls. If not provided, the default "global" environment is used.

       -f <file>
              Specifies a YAML/YML file to run. Hulak searches recursively through directories to locate matching yaml/yml files and executes all matches concurrently if more than one is found.

       -fp <file_path>
              Specifies the exact file path of the file to run.

       -dir <directory_path>
              Run entire directory concurrently. Only supports (.yaml or .yml) files. All files use the same provided environment.

       -dirseq <directory_path>
              Run entire directory one file at a time. Only supports (.yaml or .yml) files. All files use the same provided environment. 
              In nested directories, the execution order is not guaranteed to follow the file system appearance. If order matters, 
              it's recommended to use a directory without nested directories, in which case files will run alphabetically.

       migrate <json_file>
              Migrates the specified JSON file(s) to the new Hulak format.
       
       import curl [curl_command] [-o <output_path>]
              Imports a cURL command and converts it to a Hulak YAML file.
              Supports multiple input methods: command-line argument, pipe, heredoc, or file redirect.
              
              Options:
                -o <path>    Output path for the generated .hk.yaml file.
                             If not specified, creates file in imported/ directory with auto-generated name.
                             The -o flag must come before the 'curl' keyword.
              
              Input Methods:
                1. Heredoc (recommended for DevTools):
                   hulak import curl <<'EOF'
                   curl -X POST https://api.example.com/users ...
                   EOF
                
                2. Pipe:
                   echo 'curl https://api.example.com/data' | hulak import curl
                   pbpaste | hulak import curl
                
                3. File redirect:
                   hulak import curl < mycurl.txt
                
                4. Command-line argument:
                   hulak import curl 'curl https://api.example.com/users'
              
              Examples:
                hulak import curl <<'EOF'
                curl https://api.example.com/data
                EOF
                
                hulak import -o myapi.hk.yaml curl 'curl -X POST https://api.example.com/users'
                echo 'curl https://example.com' | hulak import curl
       
       init   Initializes the default environment configuration.
              When used with -env flag, creates specific environment files.
          
       help   Displays command usage information.

FLAGS
       -env    Specifies the environment file for API calls.
       -f      Designates the YAML/YML file to be executed.
       -fp     Specifies the direct file path for the file to execute.
       -dir    Run an entire directory of YAML/YML files concurrently.
       -dirseq Run an entire directory of YAML/YML files sequentially.
       -debug  Get the entire request, response, headers, and TLS info about the request 

INSTALLATION
       Hulak can be installed using either `go install` or built from source or using homebrew

       Using go install:
              go install github.com/xaaha/hulak@latest

              Ensure that your GOPATH is added to your shell's PATH:
              export GOPATH=$HOME/go
              export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
