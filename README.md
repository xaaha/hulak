### Run one request, a whole directory, or stay interactive

<img alt="Concurrent Execution" src="./assets/concurrent.gif" width="720" />

```bash
hulak run ./requests/
```

Hulak runs request files directly from your project. It supports concurrent directory execution. It falls back to an interactive picker when you simply run `hulak`.

### Dedicated GraphQL Explorer

<img alt="GraphQL Explorer" src="./assets/gql.gif" width="720" />

Browse schemas from multiple endpoints. Search operations. Build queries interactively. Execute inline. Save generated files from the terminal.

## Quick Start

### Install

Hulak ships via [xaaha/tap](https://github.com/xaaha/homebrew-tap). Homebrew 6.0+ requires explicit trust for third-party taps; without it, `brew upgrade` silently skips hulak. One-time step per machine:

```bash
brew trust xaaha/tap
brew install --cask xaaha/tap/hulak
```

Other install options:

- `go install github.com/xaaha/hulak@latest`
- Build from source with `go build -o hulak`

#### Shell completion (go install / source builds)

Homebrew installs completion automatically. If you installed via `go install`
or built from source, opt in once:

```bash
# zsh
hulak completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_hulak"        # then restart your shell

# bash (macOS, Homebrew bash-completion)
hulak completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/hulak

# bash (Linux)
hulak completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/hulak >/dev/null
```

Zsh requires `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit` in your `.zshrc`.

### Path A. API client with encrypted secrets (default)

```bash
mkdir my-apis && cd my-apis
hulak init # creates .hulak/store.age + identity
```

Scaffold a starter request, to quickly check how a request file looks run:

```bash
hulak example api  # writes example-api.hk.yaml you can run
```

> [!Note]
> For Other types run: `hulak example`. `example` sub-command gives you a quick way to write a request file you can modify. For more info run `hulak example -h`

To set up a secret you can run:

```bash
hulak secrets keys set placeholder  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts -env prod

```

Now, in your `example-api.hk.yaml` file, you can reference this secret:

```yaml
method: POST
url: "{{.placeholder}}"
# rest of the body of the file remains same
```

Run the request:

```bash
hulak run example-api.hk.yaml --env prod
```

### Prefer plaintext `env/*.env` files instead of encrypted secrets?

```bash
hulak init classic
```

Plaintext mode is fully supported. See [docs/environment.md](./docs/environment.md) for more info

## Encrypted Secrets Vault Or Plaintext `.env` files

Hulak runs in two modes. Pick once during `hulak init`. You can migrate later.

- **Vault (default):** secrets live in `.hulak/store.age`, encrypted with an age or SSH keypair. Safe to commit. Teams share via a recipients file. See [docs/store.md](./docs/store.md).
- **Plaintext:** secrets live in plaintext `env/*.env` files. Simpler, no encryption. Add `env/` to `.gitignore`. See [docs/environment.md](./docs/environment.md).

Running classic and want to switch? See [docs/migrating-to-vault.md](./docs/migrating-to-vault.md).

## Use it from an AI agent (MCP)

Hulak ships a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and Zed can drive your API collection in plain language — "list the requests", "dry-run `login` against staging", "call `getUser` and show the response".

Point your client at hulak:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hulak": {
      "command": "hulak",
      "args": ["mcp", "--project", "api=~/work/api-tests"]
    }
  }
}
```

Secrets never leave your machine: the agent works with request and environment **names**, never decrypted values. Reads and dry-runs are read-only; writes are schema-validated; response files aren't saved unless asked.

Full setup, tool reference, and safety model: [docs/mcp.md](./docs/mcp.md).

Run `hulak <command> --help` for flags and per-command examples.

### Picker behavior

Omitting `--env` opens an interactive picker.

- `hulak run` and `hulak gql` only prompt when files reference `{{.key}}`.
- `hulak secrets` subcommands prompt every time (except `secrets list`).
- Non-interactive shells require `--env <name>`.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Never commit `~/.config/hulak/identity.txt`.** That is your private key. Mode 0600. Back it up first. See [docs/store.md#identity-backup](./docs/store.md#identity-backup).
- **On `hulak init`, `-env` creates env files. It is a setup flag, not a runtime selector.** `hulak init -env staging prod` scaffolds two envs.
- **`env` is an alias for `secrets`.** `hulak env list` works the same as `hulak secrets list`.
- **GUI editors need a wait flag for `secrets edit`.** Use `EDITOR="code -w"` or `EDITOR="zed --wait"`. Without it the editor returns immediately and changes are lost.
- **Merge conflicts on `store.age` need a recipe.** See [docs/versioning.md#merge-conflicts](./docs/versioning.md#merge-conflicts).

## GraphQL Explorer

Start the explorer with a file or a directory:

```bash
hulak gql e2etests/gql_schemas/countries.yml
hulak gql .
hulak gql -env staging ./collections/graphql
```

## Schema Support

The Hulak schema is available in the [Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/), so editors that support Schema Store can automatically enable completion for `.hk.yaml` and `.hk.yml` files.

You can also point your YAML language server directly at:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaaha/hulak/refs/heads/main/assets/schema.json
```
